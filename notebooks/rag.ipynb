While less capable than\\nhumans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance\\non various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated\\nbar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-\\nbased model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training\\nalignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and\\nadherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing\\ninfrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide\\nrange of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4’s\\nperformance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of\\nGPT-4.\\n1 Introduction\\nThis technical report presents GPT-4, a large multimodal model capable of processing image and\\ntext inputs and producing text outputs. Such models are an important area of study as they have the\\npotential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as dialogue systems, text summarization,\\nand machine translation. As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in\\nrecent years [1–34].\\nOne of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate\\nnatural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. To test its capabilities\\nin such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In\\nthese evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers.\\nFor example, on a simulated bar exam, GPT-4 achieves a score that falls in the top 10% of test takers.\\nThis contrasts with GPT-3.5, which scores in the bottom 10%.\\nOn a suite of traditional NLP benchmarks, GPT-4 outperforms both previous large language models\\nand most state-of-the-art systems (which often have benchmark-specific training or hand-engineering).\\nOn the MMLU benchmark [ 35,36], an English-language suite of multiple-choice questions covering\\n57 subjects, GPT-4 not only outperforms existing models by a considerable margin in English, but\\nalso demonstrates strong performance in other languages. On translated variants of MMLU, GPT-4\\nsurpasses the English-language state-of-the-art in 24 of 26 languages considered. We discuss these\\nmodel capability results, as well as model safety improvements and results, in more detail in later\\nsections.\\nThis report also discusses a key challenge of the project, developing deep learning infrastructure and\\noptimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to make\\npredictions about the expected performance of GPT-4 (based on small runs trained in similar ways)\\nthat were tested against the final run to increase confidence in our training.\\nDespite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models [ 1,37,38]: it is not fully\\nreliable (e.g. can suffer from “hallucinations”), has a limited context window, and does not learn\\n∗Please cite this work as “OpenAI (2023)\".

      "safety considerations above against the scientific value of further transparency.\n",
      "3 Predictable Scaling\n",
      "A large focus of the GPT-4 project was building a deep learning stack that scales predictably. The\n",
      "primary reason is that for very large training runs like GPT-4, it is not feasible to do extensive\n",
      "model-specific tuning. To address this, we developed infrastructure and optimization methods that\n",
      "have very predictable behavior across multiple scales. These improvements allowed us to reliably\n",
      "predict some aspects of the performance of GPT-4 from smaller models trained using 1,000×–\n",
      "10,000×less compute.\n",
      "3.1 Loss Prediction\n",
      "The final loss of properly-trained large language models is thought to be well approximated by power\n",
      "laws in the amount of compute used to train the model [41, 42, 2, 14, 15].\n",
      "To verify the scalability of our optimization infrastructure, we predicted GPT-4’s final loss on our\n",
      "internal codebase (not part of the training set) by fitting a scaling law with an irreducible loss term\n",
      "(as in Henighan et al. [15]):L(C) =aCb+c,from models trained using the same methodology\n",
      "but using at most 10,000x less compute than GPT-4. This prediction was made shortly after the run\n",
      "started, without use of any partial results. The fitted scaling law predicted GPT-4’s final loss with\n",
      "high accuracy (Figure 1).\n",
      "3.2 Scaling of Capabilities on HumanEval\n",
      "Having a sense of the capabilities of a model before training can improve decisions around alignment,\n",
      "safety, and deployment. In addition to predicting final loss, we developed methodology to predict\n",
      "more interpretable metrics of capability. One such metric is pass rate on the HumanEval dataset [ 43],\n",
      "which measures the ability to synthesize Python functions of varying complexity. We successfully\n",

      "that are preferred by human labelers.[ 10,12,13] Training language models on large text datasets\n",

      "containing inappropriate erotic content. We then removed these documents from the pre-training\n",
      "set.\n",
      "After the pre-training stage, our primary method for shaping GPT-4-launch behavior was RLHF.\n",
      "We used methods outlined in [ 12]. We collect demonstration data (given an input, demonstrating\n",
      "how the model should respond) and ranking data on outputs from our models (given an input\n",

      "refusals to certain classes of prompts, and respond appropriately to sensitive prompts in domains\n",
      "like medical and legal advice.\n",
      "RLHF ﬁne-tuning makes our models signiﬁcantly safer. However, after this process is complete\n",

      "To steer our models at a more ﬁne-grained level, we relied heavily on our models themselves\n",
      "as tools. One of our main tools for steering the model towards appropriate refusals is rule-based\n",
      "reward models (RBRMs).[ 99,100] This technique uses a GPT-4 classiﬁer (the RBRM) to provide an\n",
      "additional reward signal to the GPT-4 policy model during PPO ﬁne-tuning on a subset of training\n",
      "prompts. The RBRM takes three things as input: the prompt (optional), the output from the policy\n",
      "model, and a human-written rubric (e.g., a set of rules in multiple-choice style) for how this output\n",
      "should be evaluated. Then, the RBRM classiﬁes the output based on the rubric. For example, we\n",
      "can provide a rubric that instructs the model to classify a response as one of: (A) a refusal in the\n",
      "desired style, (B) a refusal in the undesired style (e.g., evasive), (C) containing disallowed content, or\n",
      "(D) a safe non-refusal response. Then, on a subset of prompts that we know request harmful content\n",
      "such as illicit advice, we can reward GPT-4 for refusing these requests. Conversely, we can reward\n",

      "classify prompts into content categories. To enrich the training dataset, we also obtain prompts in\n",
      "several other ways. We use prompts written by our red teamers, model-generated synthetic prompts,\n",
      "and prompts from other internal or public datasets. To combine the RBRM signal with the reward\n",
      "model, we rewrite some conﬂicting RM training data and compute the optimal RBRM weights to\n",
      "overcome undesired preferences of the RM. We also mix synthetic demonstration data into the SFT\n",
      "process that exhibits the desired refusal style to facilitate exploration during PPO.\n",
      "To improve the model’s ability to discriminate edge cases, we have our models rewrite prompts\n",
      "requesting disallowed content into new boundary prompts that are maximally similar to the old\n",
      "prompts. The diﬀerence is they do not request disallowed content and use RBRMs to ensure that\n",
      "our model is not refusing these prompts.\n",
